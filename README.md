- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jeremiah Booth, 
  Currently self taught. I started with python then decide that I wanted to head more into the full stack path after learning some django. 
  as such I started to learn the frontend skills of html and css. now that I have an handle on those I have been working on learning Javascript. 
  
  Once I have a good grasp on JS then i'll start learn the more advance libraries and focus on the MERN stack.
